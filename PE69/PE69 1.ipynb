    "#How the function works: by keeping track of the smallest product involving the given prime (p) that is also larger than the square of the prime. The dictionary stores the most recently found compound number with the prime as a factor as its keys, and the prime as the values. Because we pop on old compound keys, the dictionary stays small, and only has n entries at any given point in its operation, where n is the number of primes found thus far.  \n",
